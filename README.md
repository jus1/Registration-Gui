# Registration-Gui
Registration program

This program is meant to be an in person gui application to remove all paper registrations
from my youth football program. I have designed the user interface, now I just need to finish
with the .get() methods which will pull the information from the entry widgets and put them into
sublists and lists so that they can be stored in .csv files and then put into Excel spreadsheets.
The info also will be used to autofill  2 forms that are in .pdf format. I haven't started the menu yet
which I'm looking to be very simplistic. A simple file drop down and a help, and readme dropdown.
